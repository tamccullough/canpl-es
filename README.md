### The Beautiful Game in Canada
The intention here is to make a robust useable system, built with python to replace this [CPL Data - Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B2ZqJczaT9k8b9ik3MUnKWIDggo_oX5M1O5lkf9d0bw/edit#gid=780793363)

I hope to incorporate Machine Learning and provide a great resource for Canadian fans of the beautiful game.
