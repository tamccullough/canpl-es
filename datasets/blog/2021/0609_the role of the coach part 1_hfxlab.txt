In other professional leagues, the role of the coach is relatively straightforward: sign players, train players, develop a strategy, and have a winning team.<br><br>The “best coach”, then, is the one who wins.<br><br>But the CanPL is not yet a typical professional league: it’s still brand new. Other leagues have established staff, infrastructure, academies, and culture - not to mention competition! For a CanPL coach, everything has to be built from scratch. It’s a huge task and a frightening responsibility, but it’s an opportunity which simply doesn’t exist anywhere else in modern soccer.<br><br>In this league, a coach has to be a warrior, a general, an architect, a doctor, a banker, a travel agent… a butcher, a baker, and a candlestick maker. So to ask who the best coach is, one either has to combine a dozen questions, or else ignore eleven answers.<br><br>The third approach, though, is to use all those surplus answers, and find out why every coach is the best in the league.  So, let us begin awarding all eight 2020 Cookbook Awards for Best Coach!<br><br>
Good coaches have to be leaders. They need to inspire loyalty, and discipline. They need to have control and confidence, and they need every player on the team to be willing to make sacrifices. These coaches have power, and you can see this in Tommy Wheeldon, Jr., and the unity he drills into his squad.<br><br>
Good coaches have to be professionals. They have to be a role model for young players, not just an inspiration but an aspiration.<br>Their experiences and networks open a team’s eyes to the future, and demonstrate just how much work is necessary, and what the reward will be. Every player on Pacific FC knows why they want to grow up to be Pa-Modou Kah.<br><br>
Good coaches have to be experts. When a player asks a question, a coach needs to have the answer. Players will push, coaches have to push back. Coaches need to be able to back up their words. It’s no secret that Jimmy Brennan is always impeccably dressed at York United games - but the reason why is that if he can’t shred those tight expensive fabrics, then he can’t tear them off and run onto the field to start playing alongside his team, and show them a few things in the process. He knows they have to learn on their own.<br><br>
Good coaches have to be a shield. Teams are attacked from all sides off the field, even from a team’s owner. A coach has to be able to protect the team, to give them the reassurance that their only job is on the pitch. Some attacks might be deflected, some will be so direct that they can only be absorbed, and some will cross a wide path, forcing a coach to be where the problem is. When Mista took the job at Atlético Ottawa, he knew that he was going to be the focus of every criticism, and that he’d be the first to go back to Spain if the owners were displeased. These are the burdens great coaches wear with pride.<br><br>
